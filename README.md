# ReNFT smart contract 

This project was designed mainly for the usecase of generating some passive income from the NFT's by renting them to the others by taking the collateral which has the worth of NFT's.

With the help of this smart contract we can easily get some money from the NFT's untill and unless it is usefull to the other person.
In this project we have used the hardhat configuration for the writing the code and deploying the smart contract .

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
